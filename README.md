# Bangla-Handwritten-Character-Recognition
Bangla Handwritten Character Recognition using different CNN architectures.

## Overview
The handwritten character recognition problem which varies among different languages due to distinct shapes, strokes and number of characters has been studied extensively during the last few decades with varying level of success. In case of Bangla Handwritten Character Recognition, here I tried different CNN architectures and made few modifications to improve the accuracy. However, I used [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to train the models and PC for further works. An overview of this project is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/NvUG36f8Dec).
