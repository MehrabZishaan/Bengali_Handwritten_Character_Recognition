# Bangla-Handwritten-Character-Recognition
Bangla Handwritten Character Recognition using different CNN architectures.

## Overview
The handwritten character recognition problem which varies among different languages due to distinct shapes, strokes, and number of characters has been studied extensively during the last few decades with varying levels of success. In the case of Bangla Handwritten Character Recognition, I tried different CNN architectures and made a few modifications to improve the accuracy. An overview of this project is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/NvUG36f8Dec).
